Cherry Almond Bark
==================

Originally made for the Techsmas 2015 party.  

Started off as a 57 T-Bird with Cape Cod plates, but moved towards something closer to the holiday spirit.

- Cranberry Juice (20ml)
- Vodka (10ml)
- Amaretto (10ml)
- White Creme de Cacao (10ml)
- Apricot Brandy (10ml)
- Cherry Bitters (1 dash)
- Vanilla Bitters (1 dash)

Combine all on ice and stir, or make ahead and chill.  Makes roughly 1 50ml shot.  (but usually batched up to larger amounts)
