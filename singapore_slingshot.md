Singapore Slingshot
===================

Originally made for the Techsmas 2014 party which had a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas Theme.

Based off of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Sling Singapore Sling but modified
to be more palatable in a shot form (mostly by drasticaly reducing the lime juice)

- Gin (30 ml)
- Pineapple Juice (25 ml)
- Lime Juice (5 ml)
- Triple Sec (15 ml)
- Cherry Brandy (15 ml)
- Benedictine (10 ml)
- Angostura Bitters (1 dash)
- Grenadine (to taste)

Combine all on ice and shake until very cold.  Makes roughly 2 50ml shots.
