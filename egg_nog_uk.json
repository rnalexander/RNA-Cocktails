  title: "Aged Egg Nog (UK ingredients)",
  description: "I generated this recipie from Alton Brown's Aged Egg Nog Recipe ( http://altonbrown.com/eggnog-recipe/ )

I've halved the volumes of his original recipe, and converted to ingredients common to the UK.  This batch should produce around 1.6-1.7l of egg nog, or enough to mostly fill a 2L bottle.

From the reading I've done the optimal aging time is about 3 weeks, so if you want this ready for Xmas, mix it up at the beginning of December.",
  ingredients: [
    { 
      name: "egg yolks (separated)",

  directions "Whisk together egg yolks and sugar until lightened in color, mix in cream and milk until all combined and most of the sugar is dissolved.  Slowly add in the booze, stirring contstantly.  Add nutmeg and salt.  Decant into empty 2L bottle (or other suitable containers) and let age in the refidgerator for three weeks optimally, althoug it's totally fine to drink right away it does smoothen and improve with age."
